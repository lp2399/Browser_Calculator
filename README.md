# CalculatorApp

orginal from webdev simplified https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&t=2001s

I added a dark mode light mode feature
when you click and hold the C for clear button it 
clears everyhting but if you click once it only deletes one digit
feel free to copy and use the code
their is a limit of characters on the calculator output div
